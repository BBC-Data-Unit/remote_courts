Court hearings held remotely in lockdown disadvantage vulnerable people, lawyers and charities warn.

In June 2020, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52854168) concerns over the impact of remote court hearings on disadvantaged and vulnerable people.

During the pandemic, the number of virtual hearings held in England and Wales increased five-fold, but family law practitioners said video and phone calls were not suitable for some sensitive cases.

There were also concerns over inequality of access to the internet and suitable technology for hearings, and the loss of opportunities to support vulnerable individuals in the court system.

This story took its starting point from [House of Commons data](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/local-data/constituency-data-magistrates-court-closures/) on the average distance people have to travel to attend Magistrates' Court before and after decisions in 2010 to close court buildings.

A key consideration regarding closures was a desire to modernise the court system and use more technology to allow video hearings and other remote communication.

Family lawyers warned remote technology was not an 'adequate substitute' for face-to-face hearings and called for careful consideration going forward.
